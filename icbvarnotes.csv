ICB add variable notes:
Prevail 1/Prevail 2: Either state [1/2] wins or compromise where they are happy, coded from monadic ICB data, where missing, from AB, where missing and post 2001, using outcome for rival in the conflict
	-note: for our data we only have win/lose/draw
Victory 1/Victory 2: same
nuclear stuff: coded directly from your stuff
kinetic: from top level of violence of either participant in mondic ICB, level > 2 (major clashes or full scale war)
kinetic 2: same but level > 1 (minor clashes also included)
a1/a2democracy: using polity score, if > 6
Salience, Independence, Complexity: for-looped from our data
other country specific vars: currently NA for ICB, need to use our coding for dyads that match, can interpolate for non matching dyads


othernotes: 98 crises in ICB dyadic and not in our data, I added 98 hist 1, crisis = 0 observations for them

Trieste 2 needs to be recoded by us, no indication its not a crisis, but not really coded

Same for Taiwan Strait I

And Serbian Train Incident

Coded missing salience for Yugoslavia/Croatia as 4 (same as for Yug/Slovenia)

Coded missing independence for Suez as 0
